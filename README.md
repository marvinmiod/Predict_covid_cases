# Predict_covid_cases
 This model predict number of new cases in Malaysia based on past Covid19 cases data


# Description
This is a project built using deep learning model with LSTM neural network to predict Covid-19 new cases in Malaysia using the past 30 days of number of cases.


# How to use it
Clone the repo and run it.

Predict_covid_module.py is a script that contains the class module of the Explatory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Creation, Model Evaluation and Training History Classes.

Predict_covid_cases.py is a script for deployment of the test dataset

Predict_covid_cases.h5 is the saved model
